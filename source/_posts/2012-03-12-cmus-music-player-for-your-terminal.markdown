###CMus Features
Here are the main features of CMus:

* Gapless playback
* ReplayGain support
* MP3 and Ogg streaming from SHOUTcast or Icecast
* Playlist support and powerful playlist filters
* Play queue
* File browser
* Last.fm or Libre.fm song submission support (via scripts)
* Seven different view modes
* Color themes
* Vi-like keyboard shortcuts

###Using CMus

First of all, we will add several songs to the media library. CMus uses Vi-style commands, so all the commands will start with : followed by a certain command. For example, to add all the audio files inside the ~/music directory, we would use:

    :add ~/music
  
To quit CMus at any time, use the :q command (or press Q followed by Y).

CMus offers seven different views, which can be accessed using the 1-7 keys. Here they are:

* 1 - Library, the default view mode, including two tabs (artists/albums and songs in currently  selected album)
* 2 - Sorted Library, which provides a playlist view allowing to jump to specific tracks (this view can be customized in view mode 6
* 3 - Playlist, editable playlist
* 4 - Play Queue, which displays the track queue
* 5 - File Browser
* 6 - Filters, a list of user-defined filters for the library
* 7 - Settings, which displays key bindings and commands
